Wireframing Response- Nicolas Parada 

	Wireframing is important because it sets up the base that websites will be built on, for the user anyways. It's a system based on discussion and 
details, rather than just designing as you go. Identifying the problem, and why its a problem at all contribute to finding the purpose behind your work
and making sure its as accessible as possible for an average user.
